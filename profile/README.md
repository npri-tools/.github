## npri-tools
The npri-tools project contextualizes publicly-available information relevant to addressing environmental racism in Canada. It contributes to initiatives such as Canada's [Bill C-226](https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/en/bill/44-1/c-226) by prototyping what a data infrastructure for it might look like.

- `npri-db`: the scripts we use to access, copy, and create new views of NPRI, Stat Can, and other data
- `dasy-can`: Dasy-Can is a GIS workflow to delineate Canadian Census boundaries by populated areas. It's used in creating new views of NPRI, Stat Can, and other data
- `pollutant_allocation`: GIS scripts for crudely estimating the distribution of NPRI-reported pollutants and summarizing them by Census Dissemination Area
- `npri-vm`: configurations for the web server hosting our copy of NPRI and Stat Can data (TBD)
- `npri`: a Python package providing easy-to-use code that returns recently reported emissions from facilities, socio-economic information for places, emissions records for specific companies and industries, and emissions trends over time
- `npri-web`: a dashboard that uses all of the above so that users can intuitively and interactively summarize NPRI information
