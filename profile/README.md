## npri-tools
The npri-tools project contextualizes publicly-available information relevant to addressing environmental racism in Canada. It contributes to initiatives such as Canada's Bill C-226 by prototyping what a data infrastructure for it might look like.

## Tools
- `npri-db`: the scripts we use to access and copy NPRI, Stat Can, and other data
- `npri-vm`: configurations for the web server hosting our copy of NPRI and Stat Can data (TBD)
- `npri`: a Python package providing easy-to-use code that returns recently reported emissions from facilities, socio-economic information for places, emissions records for specific companies and industries, and emissions trends over time
- `npri-web-*`: a set of dashboards that use all of the above so that users can intuitively and interactively summarize NPRI information (TBD)
